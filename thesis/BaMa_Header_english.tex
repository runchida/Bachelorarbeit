		I herewith formally declare that I, \BaMaAuthor{}, have written the submitted \BaMaType{} independently pursuant to § 22 paragraph 7 of APB TU Darmstadt. I did not use any outside support except for the quoted literature and other sources mentioned in the paper. I clearly marked and separately listed all of the literature and all of the other sources which I employed when producing this academic work, either literally or in content. This thesis has not been handed in or published before in the same or similar form.
		I am aware, that in case of an attempt at deception based on plagiarism (§38 paragraph 2 APB), the thesis would be graded with 5,0 and counted as one failed examination attempt. The thesis may only be repeated once.

		In the submitted thesis the written copies and the electronic version for archiving are pursuant to § 23 paragraph 7 of APB identical in content.%
